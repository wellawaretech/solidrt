# ScrollView

A scrollable region; vertical by default, `horizontal` to flip. Both the wheel and dragging scroll the content: the drag activates after a small movement threshold along the scroll axis, also when it starts on a pressable (the press is cancelled and its feedback retracts), and keeps scrolling when the pointer leaves the box. No momentum/fling yet.

```jsx
import { ScrollView, Text } from "@solidrt/components"
import { For } from "@solidrt/core"

<ScrollView layout={{ height: 300 }} style={{ backgroundColor: "#111", borderRadius: 8 }}>
  <For each={items()}>{(item) => <Text>{item}</Text>}</For>
</ScrollView>
```

The underlying geometry primitive `createScroll` is available from `@solidrt/core` for building custom scrollers.
